150california,150 California St.,Sixth-floor terrace of 24-story office tower.,As if you're on the prow of a ship cruising through the Financial District. There's even a glimpse of Marin between two towers to the north.,"Guard asks your destination as you head toward the elevators, but that's as far as it goes.",Great lunch spot with tables and a raised planter of bee-friendly salvia. More a place to chill than gape.,00.jpg,Amy Osborne
343sansome,343 Sansome St.,15th-floor rooftop above the Financial District.,Office towers in abundance but also several ornate cornices and a wedge of Treasure Island beyond the Embarcadero Center.,"None. You get on an elevator. Bronze plaques outside could be larger, but they look nice.","The decor needs freshening up, but other than that, terrific. Wooden benches beneath olive trees. Tables along the edge include pillows on the chairs.",05.jpg,Lea Suzuki
543howard,543 Howard St.,Rooftop of five-story building from 1924.,"Tomorrow's city today, with Salesforce Tower clambering upward while the Transbay Transit Center stretches below you across the street. A housing tower is rising directly to the south.","You need to sign in. At least the front door's now unlocked, which wasn't the case for several months.","Ripped-from-the-headlines views, drenched in sun. Too bad about the construction noise.",01.jpg,Amy Osborne
1011stst,100 First St.,Second-floor rooftop of parking garage alongside a 1988 office tower.,Say hello to the Transbay Transit Center — you can almost touch the perforated metal screen above Minna Street. Across Mission Street is a fenced-off lot where a hotel tower will soon break ground.,"Easy access via stairway from sidewalk. Inside, take elevator to second floor and walk through doors. Only problem is, general public can't get back inside, which seems to violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.",Arguably suburban sterile — but also the only rooftop with mature trees and real grass.,07.jpg,Lea Suzuki
onemontgomery,1 Montgomery St.,Public space atop two-story remnant of Willis Polk's 1908 Crocker Bank Building.,Highlight is bird's-eye perspective on the Palace Hotel and its neon sign.,None. Stairs are inside the Crocker Galleria arcade to the west. Elevator in the small lobby alongside entrance to Polk's banking hall.,"The owner's disdain for the public is deplorable, with broken or warped slats making several wooden benches unusable. Ornamental columns are cracking, too. Still, a popular lunch spot.",09.jpg,Liz Hafalia
onekearny,One Kearny,"11th-floor terrace above Market Street, next to copper-clad peaked roof from 1906.","Dynamic. Vistas straight out Market to Twin Peaks and down Third Street to the bay. Plus a boxy collage of classics old and new, masonry and metal and glass.","Daunting. You sign in and show a photo ID, which the security guard takes in exchange for a key to the bathroom if needed.","High in more ways than one. Besides cool views, nice snug landscape of benches and ferns.",03.jpg,Liz Hafalia
westfield,"Westfield San Francisco Centre, 835 Mission St.","Ninth-floor rooftop of shopping mall, next to restored glass Emporium dome.",Dome — and the mechanical equipment around it. Potrero Hill beckons in the distance.,"Photo ID required at security desk of office lobby. Sign by door to Market Street, but nothing in mall.","Grim. The tables that made this a busy lunchtime spot were removed last year and the newish backless metal benches are already rusted. On the bright side, Westfield management says new tables and chairs “and other amenities” will be installed next year.",04.jpg,Lea Suzuki
intercontinental,"Hotel InterContinental, 888 Howard St.",Fourth- and sixth-floor terraces on the side of 31-story slab.,"Glass wall of dental school smack to your north, backside of Moscone West convention center to your east. At least you can wave to Sutro Tower in the distance to your west.","None, if you know your destination. Only sign outside is stenciled onto building, gray on white.","Dismal. Top terrace is a dull void, lower one sits within a plastic events tent, humid as a sweat lodge.",02.jpg,Liz Hafalia
hampton,"Hampton Inn, 952 Mission St.",Rooftop of new 15-story hotel.,"The most panoramic of the lot, including such local landmarks as the trees of Lafayette Park and the shipping cranes on the southern shoreline. Also, as of early September, 19 construction cranes.","Instead of showing ID, you must sign an “indemnity agreement.” We kid you not.",Stark decor — only seating is benches that also screen mechanical equipment — but a wide-open feel.,06.jpg,Lea Suzuki
federal,"San Francisco Federal Building, 90 Seventh St.",A three-story “sky garden” on the 11th through 13th floors of 18-story government high-rise.,"Framed open-air portrait of South of Market and points beyond, with nothing in the way.","Getting into this federal structure is like passing through airport security, except you don't take off your shoes.","Loads of seating, no wind factor, and navigating the tower's interior gets you up close and personal with architect Thom Mayne's energetic flair.",08.jpg,Liz Hafalia
